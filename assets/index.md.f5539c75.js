Back then, I bought a book on PHP from Hugendubel, and at just 15 years old, I launched the first version of <a href="http://coaching-institutes.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">coaching-institutes.net</a>. What started as a simple experiment turned into a 20-year-long journey of building, scaling, and maintaining a platform with over 10,000 users.</p><p>Along the way, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics, which not only sharpened my analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of well-structured software. Mathematics taught me to think in systems, abstractions, and logical flows-skills that I now bring into my development work every single day.</p><p>Today, <a href="http://coaching-institutes.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">coaching-institutes.net</a> is still my main project, and I continue to evolve its architecture and features with modern web technologies like Laravel, Vue.js, and Inertia.</p><hr><h2 id="\u{1F680}-why-this-guide" tabindex="-1">\u{1F680} <strong>Why This Guide?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F680}-why-this-guide" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Over the years, I faced countless challenges and learned to master concepts like multi-tenancy database design, advanced Docker setups for legacy applications, and clean modular architectures. I have built complex CI/CD pipelines in GitLab, optimized database transactions and deadlocks, and debugged tricky race conditions with Xdebug.</p><p>This guide is my personal vault of best practices, advanced techniques, and hard-learned lessons. It&#39;s designed for developers who want to go beyond tutorials and dive deep into real-world applications. You will find structured solutions and practical advice for scaling, maintaining, and optimizing modern web applications.</p><hr><h2 id="\u{1F3A5}-follow-my-journey" tabindex="-1">\u{1F3A5} <strong>Follow My Journey</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F3A5}-follow-my-journey" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>I also share my experiences on YouTube with step-by-step tutorials, so you can follow along as I build, refactor, and optimize projects.</p><hr><p>Ready to get started? \u2192 <a href="/setup/GettingStarted.html">Getting Started with Setup and Installation</a> \u{1F680}</p>',16),r=[o];function s(l,d,h,c,u,p){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const g=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{y as __pageData,g as default};
